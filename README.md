## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates how to configure **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** to implement the **principle of least privilege**.  
It includes the full process of:  
- Creating IAM users  
- Attaching custom JSON IAM policies  
- Restricting access to only the required EC2 actions (`ec2:Describe*`)  
- Testing and validating permissions using the **AWS Policy Simulator**

## üßë‚Äçüíª Skills Demonstrated
- **AWS IAM** (users, groups, and custom policies)  
- **Cloud Security** best practices  
- **Principle of Least Privilege** enforcement  
- **JSON Policy Authoring** (`Effect`, `Action`, `Resource`, `Condition`)  
- **AWS Policy Simulator** for safe permission testing  
- **GitHub Portfolio Building** (repo setup, topics, documentation, screenshots)  

---

## üöÄ Key Takeaways
- IAM **defaults to ‚Äúdeny‚Äù** all actions unless explicitly allowed.  
- An **Allow** statement grants access only to listed actions.  
- An **Explicit Deny** always overrides an Allow.  
- The **Policy Simulator** is an essential tool for validating IAM policies before deploying them to production.  
- Documenting your work in a clear GitHub repo helps recruiters and hiring managers see your hands-on cloud security skills quickly.
